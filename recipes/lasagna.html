        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat
                 until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, f
                ennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, 
                covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
                     boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                     Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, 
                     combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                    Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
                    Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
